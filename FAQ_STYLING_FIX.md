# FAQ Section Styling - Fix Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **CSS Framework Conflicts**
- **Problem**: FAQ component was using Tailwind CSS classes, but your project has custom CSS architecture
- **Solution**: Created dedicated `FAQ.css` file with descendant selectors to avoid conflicts

### 2. **Styling Not Applied**
- **Problem**: Tailwind classes like `py-16`, `bg-gray-50`, `text-center` were not being rendered
- **Solution**: Replaced all Tailwind classes with custom CSS using specific descendant selectors

### 3. **Specificity Issues**
- **Problem**: Global CSS reset and Tailwind imports were overriding FAQ styles
- **Solution**: Used `!important` declarations and highly specific descendant selectors

## üé® Visual Enhancements Added

### 1. **Modern Design**
- Gradient background with subtle patterns
- Enhanced shadows with depth
- Smooth hover animations with lift effect
- Rounded corners and modern spacing

### 2. **Interactive Elements**
- Improved toggle icon with circular background
- Smooth color transitions on hover/active states
- Better animation timing with cubic-bezier curves
- Visual feedback for all interactive states

### 3. **Better Typography**
- Improved font weights and sizes
- Better line heights for readability
- Proper color contrast for accessibility
- Responsive text scaling

### 4. **Enhanced Animations**
- Smoother expand/collapse with better easing
- Icon rotation animation
- Hover effects with subtle transformations
- Optimized transition durations

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 1. **Descendant Selectors Used**

.faq-section .container { }
.faq-section .faq-header h2 { }
.faq-section .faq-question-button { }
.faq-section .faq-toggle-icon { }
.faq-section .faq-answer-content { }
```

### 2. **Conflict Prevention**
